 ## Samsung Data Code Book / Data Dictionary

There are five data sets that can be combined and manipulated to see the results of the testing on the sensors inside the Samsung phone.

These data sets are 
1. Subject (subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt)
2. Activity (activity_labels.txt)
3. Label (y_train.txt, y_test.txt)
4. Features (features.txt)
5. Data (X_train.txt, X-test.txt)

The R scriptthat produces the output text file modifies these data sets so that the test and train data are combined, descriptors 
are placed on the data columns from the Features file, activitys are mapped to the data from the Label files, subjects are mapped 
to the data from the Subject files.  Activities are given readable names from the Activity file.  

The data is then reduced to only view the mean and standard deviation variables and finally the data is grouped and summarized so the 
run_analysis_output.txt file shows the average of the mean and standard deviations across all remaning vairiables grouped by Subject and 
Activity.

Here is a small cut of what that output file looks like (the column headers look better when read into file viewing tool like R Studio
file editor or Excel (sapce delimieted)...

1. Subject data 
The test data consists of 2947 rows of single-variable integer data.
The train data consists of 7352 rows of single-variable integer data.
(based on the number of rows in these data sets, it is assumed that these rows map 1:1 to the rows in the data sets and correspond to the subjects under test)

2. Activity data 
There are five activities that the subject performed to collect the data 
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

3. Label data
The test data consists of 2947 rows of single-variable integer data.
The train data consists of 7352 rows of single-variable integer data.
(based on the number of rows in these data sets, it is assumed that these rows map 1:1 to the rows in the data sets and correspond to the activities being performed)

4. Feature data 
he features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
 
5. Data 
The raw test data consists of 2947 observations of 561 variables described by the features.  The raw train data consists of 7352 observations of 561 variables described by the features
